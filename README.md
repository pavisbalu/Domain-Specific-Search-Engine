# Group A1 - IR Assignment

## Problem Statement
The task is to build a search engine which will cater to the needs of a particular domain. You have to feed your IR
model with documents containing information about the chosen domain. It will then process the data and build indexes.
Once this is done, the user will give a query as an input. You are supposed to return top 10 relevant documents as the
output. Your results should be explainable. The design document should clearly explain the working of the model along
with detailed explanation of any formulas that you might have used. . For Eg:

- You can build a search engine for searching song lyrics.
  Dataset: https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/musixmatch
- Other domains on which you can find datasets easily are:
    - Product review - https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products
    - Healthcare - https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/medal-emnlp
    - Finance
    - Automobiles

You may also choose your own domain and [crawl data from the web](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Web_scraping) using the
crawler described below in the additional resources. You are free to use your
own [web crawler](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/10/beginner-guide-web-scraping-beautiful-soup-python/).
